# System Admin / DevOps Engineer Test

## IMPORTANT:
- Deadline is usually +3 days (12NN +4GMT) from the moment the test was sent to you (Example: If sent on Monday, deadline is Thursday at 12NN +4GMT).
- Ouput that needs to be sent to us:
    - Working URL of the app that can be accessible online.
    - Upload the project to your own repo and send us the link (optional but highly recommended as this will be discussed during the next phase of the interview).
- Describe extra step that you took to make your output outstanding compare to other candidates (Example: setting up SSL, LB, etc...)

### Test assignment A: Docker and Microservices
**Objective:** To assess the candidate’s ability to work with Docker and microservices architecture.

**Task Description:**
- This app includes App (PHP), MySQL and Redis services.
- Containerize these services using Docker. Each service should have its own Dockerfile.
- Write a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the services.
- Ensure that the services can communicate with each other and are scalable.
- Document the steps to build and run the containers, and any assumptions made in the process.
- Send us the repo link (optional but highly recommended).

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Understanding of Docker concepts and containerization.
- Ability to set up a microservices architecture.
- Quality of the Dockerfiles and docker-compose configurations.
- Documentation and clarity of instructions.

### Test assignment B: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
**Objective:** To evaluate the candidate's experience with CI/CD pipelines and version control systems.

**Task Description:**
- Using the output from Test A. 
- Create a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions (The pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application).
- Document the CI/CD setup and provide instructions on how the pipeline works, including how to trigger builds and deployments.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Proficiency in using version control (Git).
- Ability to set up and configure CI/CD pipelines.
- Understanding of automated testing and its integration into CI/CD.
- Documentation quality and the ability to explain the CI/CD process.

### Test assignment C: Deployment to a Cloud or Server Environment
**Objective:**  To assess the candidate’s ability to deploy applications to a cloud or server environment, integrating the work done in Test B.

**Task Description:**
- Take the CI/CD pipeline and the web application developed in Test B (If you are not familiar with CI/CD, you may use output from Test A instead).
- Extend the CI/CD pipeline to include a deployment stage that automatically deploys the application to a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP) or a server environment of your choice.
- Ensure the deployment includes necessary environment configurations (like virtual networks, security groups, etc.) and is scalable.
- Implement basic monitoring and logging for the application in the cloud/server environment.
- Document the deployment process, including any scripts or configuration files used, and instructions on how to access the deployed application.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Ability to integrate deployment into an existing CI/CD pipeline.
- Understanding of cloud services and server management (depending on the deployment target).
- Implementation of security best practices in the deployment.
- Setup of basic monitoring and logging for the application.
- Quality of documentation and ease of accessing the deployed application.
